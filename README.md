# Zen (Python) 

>Not sure if C has taught me to think like a programmer or python is just really easy.

<details>
<summary>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters</summary>
<br>
Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
Simple is better than complex.<br>
Complex is better than complicated.<br>
Flat is better than nested.<br>
Sparse is better than dense.<br>
Readability counts.<br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
Although practicality beats purity.<br>
Errors should never pass silently.<br>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
Now is better than never.<br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## About
- This repository consists of all the Python programming projects doneüôÇ in the [ ALX Africa](https://www.alxafri    a.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course by [Ayomide Kayode](https://github.com/AyomideKayode).
 19 - All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We (the students) build functions that produce a specific     output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
